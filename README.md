### üì¶ Installation

To set up and run EduTutor AI, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/kamsalideepika/Edutuor-AI](https://github.com/kamsalideepika/Edutuor-AI)
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the cloned directory and install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    cd Edutuor-AI
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you have `pip` installed and consider using a virtual environment for better project isolation.)*

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

You have two primary ways to run the `finalgenaifix.ipynb` notebook:

* **Option A: Google Colab (Recommended for ease of use and GPU access)**
    1.  Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    2.  Click `File` > `Upload notebook` and select `finalgenaifix.ipynb` from your cloned repository.
    3.  Once opened, go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as the hardware accelerator (if available and desired), then click `Save`.
    4.  Run all cells (`Runtime` > `Run all`). The Gradio interface will launch directly in the output of the last cell, providing a public URL.

* **Option B: Local Jupyter Environment (Requires local Python/Jupyter setup)**
    1.  Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed (`pip install notebook` or `pip install jupyterlab`).
    2.  Navigate to your cloned directory in your terminal.
    3.  Launch Jupyter:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        jupyter lab
        ```
    4.  Open `finalgenaifix.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface in your web browser.
    5.  Run all cells in the notebook.
